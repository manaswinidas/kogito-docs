# 0.5.0

## Release date - mid-October 2019

### Main themes of the release 

* DMN generated REST endpoints that provide access to evaluating entire model or defined decision services
* Support for intermediate and boundary events for messages and timers - timers are currently in memory only 
* Support for cloud events payload when using message events which enables correlation between processes that exchange messages
* Support for embedded subprocess
* GraphQL subscription for both domain and technical data types (e.g. process instances, user tasks)
* Quarkus extension has moved from JSON be to JACKSON for JSON marshalling â€¦ so in case you use kogito-maven-plugin directly you most likely need to update dependencies - see kogito-examples
* Initial version for security enabled REST endpoints for processes - it currently relies on manual XML editing as there is no support in tooling for it
* published version of VSCode editors for BPMN and DMN
* BPMN/DMN chrome extension alpha
