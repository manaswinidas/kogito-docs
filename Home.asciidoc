= Overview

*Kogito* is *cloud-nativ business automation* for building intelligent application.  Build cloud-native applications by leveraging business processes and rules to extract the business logic from your code.  Kogito takes advantage of the many benefits of the cloud because it was designed from the ground up to target that environment.

Key characteristics are:

* *Cloud-first*: Kogito is designed from ground up to run at scale on cloud infrastructure. If you think about business automation think about the cloud as this is where your business logic lives these days. By taking advantage of the latest technologies (Quarkus, knative, etc.), you get amazingly fast boot times and instant scaling on orchestration platforms like Kubernetes.

* *Domain-specific*: Kogito adopts to your business domain rather than the other way around. No more leaking abstraction of the tool into your client applications. Stay focused on what the business is about instead of being concerned with technology behind it.

* *Developer power*: Kogito offers a powerful developer experience based on battle-tested components. Achieve instant developer efficiency by having tooling embeddable wherever you need it, code generation taking care of 80% of the work, flexibility to customize, only use what you need and simplified local development with live reload

It originates from well known Open Source projects (https://drools.org[Drools], https://jbpm.org[jBPM], https://optaplanner.org[OptaPlanner]) and takes advantage of the experience the https://github.com/orgs/kiegroup[this team] has built over more than a decade in mission critical systems around the globe.
